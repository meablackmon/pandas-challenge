# pandas-challenge
Had a difficult time with this challenge, did the best that I could. Worked with a study for the first portion of the assignment.
Started to struggle with the second half of the assisgnment and just coulnd't get it had so many errors and am just frustrated. Plan on getting a tutoring session tomorrow to help me further understadn the assignment.
